        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        Kingslayer was an academic project I embarked on in the class IAT 265: Multimedia Programming for Art and Design. <br> <br>
        Kingslayer is a challenging bullet hell where the avatar is pit against several bosses in the form of levels, where the player has to dodge against the bosses’ onslaught of attacks wielding only a sword and a pistol. <br><br>
        Through this project, I aimed to explore how to design fast-paced gameplay by taking inspiration from the platform bullet hell genre. <br>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        Kingslayer features 3 incremental bosses with their own individual attack patterns, which increases in difficulty and complexity as the boss’s health diminishes, creating high-action gameplay that keeps players on their toes. <br> <br>
        Kingslayer also includes a shop that allows players to upgrade their abilities after every boss, and difficulty options that allow players to play at the level they’re comfortable with. <br>
        <h2>Planning and Proposal</h2>
        <h2>Art and Animation</h2>
        <h2>Sound Design</h2>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        Throughout this project, I learned a lot about the process of game design and how elements of high-action gameplay can be designed to give the player a sense of challenge. With more experience in animation and sound design under my belt, I hope to touch on these skills in the future and develop my personal style in those fields.
