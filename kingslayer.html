        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        Kingslayer is a platformer bullet hell game made as part of the class IAT 167: Digital Games: Genre, Structure, Programming and Play at SFU. <br> <br>
        In Kingslayer, the player is pit against several bosses in their own levels, where they have to dodge against the bosses’ onslaught of different projectile attacks wielding only a sword and a pistol. <br><br>
        Through this project, I aimed to explore how to design fast-paced gameplay by taking inspiration from existing games in the platform bullet hell genre and making my own. <br>

          <figcaption>Kingslayer stage select screen.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        Kingslayer features 3 incremental bosses with their own individual attack patterns, which increases in difficulty and complexity as the boss’s health diminishes, creating high-action gameplay that keeps players on their toes. <br> <br>
        Kingslayer also includes a shop that allows players to upgrade their abilities after every boss, and difficulty options that allow players to play at the level they’re comfortable with. <br>

        <h2>Planning and Proposal</h2>
        When making the proposal for the project, I wanted to streamline the process so that I could clearly follow up on my concept down the line. Clearly sectioning systems and different aspects of design allowed me to easily refer back to the document later.

            <figcaption>First page of Kingslayer proposal. Most of the remaining proposal is formatted similarly, in short points/sentences in order to make it easy to refer to.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Initial sketches for the game, showing gameplay layout as well as some menu layouts.</figcaption>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Art and Animation</h2>
        The main goal of the art and animation in the game is to clearly convey what situation the player is in, with art representing the narrative and the animation representing the state of the game.
        <div class="proj-img proj-process">
          <div class="proj-process-item">

            <figcaption>The King's break animation. Represents a state of weakness that tells the player that he is currently vulnerable.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>One of the Queen's warning animations. This is to signal to the player that an attack is coming, with the colour purple representing an attack where the Queen will deploy orbs that will fire lasers.</figcaption>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Sound Design</h2>
        In designing sound effects for the game, I recorded basic sounds with objects I had lying around and used Audacity to perform some simple edits. The main goal was to give the player a clear indication as to what was happening in the game not only through visuals, but also through sound.

          <figcaption>Sample workspace for sound design. Shown above is the effect for buying upgrades, which was made by shaking small coins in a pouch.</figcaption>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        Throughout this project, I learned a lot about the process of game design and how elements of high-action gameplay can be designed to give the player a sense of challenge. With more experience in animation and sound design under my belt, I hope to touch on these skills in the future and develop my personal style in those fields.
